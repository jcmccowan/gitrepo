Git Instructions:

From ps11.pstcc.edu,
File transfer into a dedicated directory on your machine.
In the git shell, get into this directory.
git init to initialize a git repository on your local machine
git add [directory name]
git commit -m "Your message explaining what this commit is for"
git remote add origin https://github.com/fiskr/growler.git
git push https://github.com/fiskr/growler.git

Just make sure you type your user name and password correctly in the shell- you can't backspace.
