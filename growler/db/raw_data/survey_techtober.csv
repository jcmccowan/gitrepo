3,5,5,5,5,Good presentation style.  Would like to see a demo
3,2,4,4,4,
3,4,5,4,4,
3,5,5,5,5,
4,3,4,3,5,Good job overall.  Demo was pretty scattered & unclear.  Deborah's part was most interesting--maybe should have come first?
4,5,5,3,4,
4,4,5,5,5,Great info on DV.  We need to get Tableau in house and not use trial versions.  Good info on internet tools!  Thanks.
4,3,3,3,4,"Perhaps a bit too technical.  Put Deborah's stuff first & expand a bit.  Would have liked to have seen 4 techniques in general, perhaps contrasting and comparing the techniques. Seemed a bit dat focused and concentrating on one tool (Tableau) didn't give a clear picture of general techniques--e.g. ways to visualize, problems with tools, business and technical challenges, etc."
4,5,5,5,5,Nice Job!
4,4,4,,5,"There was a whole lot of information but I can see the possibilities of the tool.  The presenters went very quickly and it was a bit hard to grasp all that went on.  Also, it was very difficult to see all the detail on the screen."
4,4,4,4,4,"Would be great if they started with a business question/problem and then demonstrated how to answer it.  The tech demo was great, but it was hard to follow all the clicks and understand how well it matched our needs"

4,5,5,5,5,It is a very good session to understand what we can achieve with 4.
4,4,4,3,5,
4,4,5,5,5,
4,3,4,3,5,Feel the presenters tried to include too much in this session.  The demo portion went way TOO FAST.
4,4,4,4,5,Fascinating topic
5,5,5,5,5,Quick and informative
5,3,4,3,,Lights are turned down too much.  I expected the speaker to fill the alloted time slot.

9,5,5,4,5,G0P!
9,5,5,5,5,This topic needs more exposure throughout the company!
9,4,4,3,3,
9,5,5,5,5,
9,4,5,3,3,"Please amplify speakers.  Hard to hear.  Good length, might be good to have a mechanism for Q&A re: this presentation"
9,5,5,4,5,I agree with the need to move to a 30P workflow
9,4,4,4,4,Interested in more
9,3,5,4,5,
9,5,5,4,5,
9,5,5,5,5,Very good
9,4,5,3,5,The presenter was difficult to hear at times
9,4,4,3,4,Required some detailed knowledge of video specifications.  Could have used more time I think.
9,4,4,4,4,
9,5,5,4,5,
9,5,5,4,3,One presenter much stronger than the other.  Session was extremely useful for my role.  Complex topic was presented understandably.

10,5,5,5,5,Great talk!  Shows the pain points involved with data management at SNI.
